# Instagram-Captioning
 Run Instagram photos through a pytorch neural network for captioning and compare the result to the captions given.
 
 Models are pretrained and can be found at https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/tree/master/tutorials/03-advanced/image_captioning.
 
 The model files themselves are not included but they can be downloaded from the link above.

This is an example of the output run on the Instagram profile "Photos":

As you can see, the captioning does not work for certain pictures, usually ones that are just pictures of scenery without a defined subject or selfies.
